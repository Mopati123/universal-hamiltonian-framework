Scheduler Module - Baseline Measurement (Minimal Critical Path)

Framework-Guided Implementation:
  - 3-Tier Logic: Validated necessity & approach
  - 4-Tier Validation: Math → Implementation → Domain → Meta
  - Self-Evolution: Modified from comprehensive to minimal

Philosophy:
  Measure MINIMUM needed to gate Phase 2:
    1. Sharpe Ratio (is it profitable?)
    2. Latency (is it fast?)
    3. Energy Conservation (is physics preserved?)
  
  Can expand later if needed (we're in superposition!)
